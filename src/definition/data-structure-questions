Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
deleting, insertion, searching


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
what is an Array?
is an object which contains elements of a similar data type

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
 Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class

what is LinkedList?
class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements

How is an Array different from Linked List?
linked list has object metadata overhead because each Node of the linked list is an object.
an array requires less memory than a linked list for storing the same number of elements

what is queue?
used to insert elements at the end of the queue and removes from the beginning of the queue

what is stack?
it is LIFO

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is first in first out
LIFO is last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
complexity measures the time taken for running an algorithm and it is commonly used to count the number
of elementary operations performed by the algorithm to improve the performance.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?

what is tree in data structure?
trees are hierarchical data structures

what is graph in data structure?

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashmap is much faster then HaschTable

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
can manually copy elements by using a loop, create a clone of the array, use Arrays.copyOf() method or
System.arrayCopy() to start copying elements from one array to another in Java.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
it is thier structure

What is DFS and BFS?
The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS)

What is Recursion?
 is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
 in liner elements are linked one after the other. and non liner are not

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
 Insertion sort,Selection sort,Merge sort,Heapsort,Quicksort,Bubble sort,Shellsort,Comb sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
